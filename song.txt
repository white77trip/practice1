My libido's a beating drum
Everything is yet to come
Lizard king that I've become
Preparing for the future run, ah
Everything is yet to blend (-íî)
Mixing with my dirty friend
Our group has always been
And always will until the end

You know I'm a black unicorn
I'm a magnetic flare, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
And don't know me at all
Nevermind, I don't care
